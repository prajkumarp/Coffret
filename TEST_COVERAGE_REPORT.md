## Methodology

This coverage report was generated using Xcode's built-in code coverage tools with the following command:

```bash
xcodebuild test -scheme Coffret \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' \
  -enableCodeCoverage YES
```

Coverage data was extracted using:
```bash
xcrun xccov view --report [xcresult_bundle_path]
```

## Next Review

The next coverage review should be conducted after addressing the critical FTP and Web connection testing gaps. Target date: 2 weeks from current sprint completion.
