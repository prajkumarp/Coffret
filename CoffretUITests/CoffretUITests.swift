/**
 UI tests for the Coffret FTP Server application.
 
 This test suite provides end-to-end testing of the user interface
 and user interactions within the Coffret app. It validates the
 complete user experience from app launch to file operations.
 
 ## Test Coverage
 - App launch and initial UI state
 - Server start/stop functionality
 - File tree navigation and interactions
 - File import and export operations
 - Context menu operations
 - Alert and dialog interactions
